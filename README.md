## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM

### What I learned

From this challenge I learned to use Tailwind CSS, where tailwind CSS is something that I have just used after all this time I have continuously used Bootstrap, I learned it from the installation stage to configuration to how to use the classes in Tailwind CSS.

Besides that, I also learned how to use Javascript DOM for object manipulation.

### Continued development

I haven't thought about the continuation of this project, if you have an idea for the continuation of this project you can contact me.
